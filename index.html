    AI has always been a very controversial topic. People are still unsure if it's safe and if the benefits outweigh the negatives.
    However, recently the US government has been trying to implement the technology of AI into machinery and weapons to help benefit the US army and to help reduce casualties for soldiers. 
    For instance, drones have started to frequently be used on battlefields in order to help check and clear buildings instead of sending soldiers. While this has helped keep casualties down, 
    the government fear that if they decide to implement AI into these drones or in other machinery, they could potentially cause more damage than good by running the risk that individual 
    companies or other countries will decide to follow this path which could lead to an AI war.

    The development of AI has been one of the most transformative technological advancements in human history.<a href="#1">  Recently, programmers have been able to create an AI model which can find and create
    drugs to cure specific diseases (Uknown: Killer Robots, 2023) </a>. The model was praised highly by the government and the creators behind it were asked to give a presentation at a talk show so they 
    could highlight and explain to others how it worked. In the presentation, they decided to mention how devastating the misuse of this technology could be, so they conducted an experiment where instead 
    of coding the AI to find cures and treatments to diseases, it generated the most toxic molecules and elements known to mankind and all it took was changing a 0 to a 1 in the code. An article was later published
    (SCIAM, 2022) which talked in depth about the experiment that was conducted and how it all happened. To everyone's surprise, the model was created on a standard 2015 MAC and only took less than 6 hours of machine 
    time to create the model. While everyone was panicking at how simple it was to create something so destructive in a matter of hours, the US government saw this as an opening to introduce AI into the battlefield. 
    The main route into making AI machinery and placing it into a warzone with it working efficiently, is to implement machine learning into it.  This provides machines the ability to automatically learn from data and 
    past experiences to identify patterns and make predictions with minimal human intervention (Spiceworks, 2022). The US government decided to implement this strategy into dogfighting, when fighter jets go against each other. 
    Programmers created an AI jet and placed it into a virtual world with another jet being controlled by a human (Uknown: Killer Robots 2023). At first, the AI struggled to even make the jet fly in a straight line, however, 
    after a few days the AI had completely mastered the art of dogfighting through machine learning. To further highlight how devastating this was, scientists decided to set up a game between the AI and a pilot who has been in 
    the air force for over 20 years. The pilot would wear a VR headset and would have surrounding gear to replicate the environment of being in an actual jet. They both played 10 rounds against each other and very quickly the audience 
    watching realized how terrifying machine learning is. The AI won all 10 rounds with ease, the pilot said he’d never seen such precise movement from a jet before and that the way the AI pursued him in the fight was unrealistic and simply
    not human. There is, however, one danger to machine learning which has even caught the US government’s attention and that is autonomous weapons and use of force. The single greatest concern involving AI and the pentagon is the 
    integration of AI into weapons systems such that they can function autonomously, delivering lethal force without intervention or meaningful human control (AI Joe: Public Citizen, 2024). For military sergeants, the advantages of 
    autonomous weapons are very clear; they can engage in war-fighting without any direct risks and can be much cheaper than conventional weapons. However, these benefits are vastly outweighed by the immorality of delegating decisions over 
    the deployment of lethal force to machines. The gravest concern surrounding autonomous weapons is their inherit dehumanization of targets, making it easier to accept widespread killing, even if it violates international human rights. 
    “The use of autonomous weapon systems entails risk due to the difficulties in anticipating and limiting their effects”, (International Committee of the Red Cross, 2024). While there are a lot of issues concerning using AI in machinery
    for wars, if monitored correctly and controlled, it can save many lives and time for certain situations. On November 6th, 2024, the Global Initiative on Resilience to Natural Hazards met for the first time to discuss the topic of using
    AI in order to help reduce casualties during Natural Disasters. One of the representatives, Monique Kuglitsch, spoke about how AI has helped policymakers identify the best places to put traffic sensors to detect road blockages after
    tropical storms. A few months later, meteorologists used AI weather forecasting models to accurately predict where Hurrican Milton would land, Harry Booth & Tharin Pillay (2024) How AI is being used Respond to Natural Disasters in Cities.
    The Times.  The US government have also been able to create AI robots and drones which can help locate bodies trapped under debrief and people stuck in forest fires as they’ve been installed with infrared sensors allowing them to pinpoint
    survivors at a faster rate than human (Uknown: Killer Robots 2023). In conclusion, AI holds immense potential offering tools that that can enhance our lives and tackle some of humanities greatest problems. From revolutionizing our 
    healthcare and helping to tackle natural disasters, AI’s potential for good is staggering. However, its power also brings significant risks. Misuse, lack of regulation and ethical lapses could bring upon the deaths of many people 
    and could even be the start of another world war. Ultimately, the impact of AI depends on the choices we make. By prioritizing the ethical development when implementing AI into machinery, we can harness it as a force for positive transformation. 
    The future is in our hands, and how we use this powerful technology will define its legacy.
